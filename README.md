# Hidden-Markov-Model
This is a programming assignment done for the CSCI 567 - Machine Learning class.

The above code implments the following concepts:
1) Forward and backward algorithm
2) Sequence Probability
3) Posterior Probability
4) Likelihood of two consecutive states at a given time
5) Viterbi algorithm
6) Speech Tagger

hmm.py,tagger.py and utils.py implements the algorithm for HMM. This is a complete implementation that is also provided with a test dataset on pos tags.

To run the above code: $ python hmm_test_script.py
